Q1: What are the characteristics of the tuples? Is tuple immutable?
They are indexed.
Tuples are ordered.
These are immutable.
They can contain duplicate items.

Q2:What are the two tuple methods in python? Give an example of each method. Give a reason why
tuples have only two in-built methods as compared to Lists.
two methods are:
count and index
Thats because they are immutable and values in the tuples can not be updated. 
t1.index(2) - returns the index of value 2 in the tuple
t1.count(2) - returns how many times value 2 is in the touple. 
Q3:Which collection datatypes in python do not allow duplicate items? Write a code using a set to remove
duplicates from the given list.
Sets will remove duplicate items
no_dupes = set(List)
no_dupes
Q4:
union will combine two sets into a one large dataset removing duplicates 
firstSet = {2, 3, 4, 5}
secondSet = {1, 3, 5, 7}
print(firstSet | secondSet)
# {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}

update:
set = {'a', 'b'}
other_set = {1, 2, 3}
set.update(other_set)
set
# {1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b'}

Updates a particular set with values from another set that are not in the first set. 
Q5: What is a dictionary? Give an example. Also, state whether a dictionary is ordered or unordered.
dictionary is a collection that contains a key that has to be unique and a value that does not have to be unique
d = {'k1': 1, 'k2': 2, 'k3': 3}
depending on the version of Python dictionaries are either ordered or unordered. As of Python version 3.7 dictionaries are ordered, before this version dictionaries are unordered.

Q6:
We can create a nested dictionary. 
nested_dict = { 'dictA': {'key_1': 'value_1'},
                'dictB': {'key_2': 'value_2'}}

Q7: Using setdefault() method, create key named topics in the given dictionary and also add the value of
the key as this list ['Python', 'Machine Learningâ€™, 'Deep Learning']
dict1 = {'language' : 'Python', 'course': 'Data Science Masters'}

dict1.setdefault("topics", ["Python", "Machine Learning", "Deep Learning"])

dict1

{'language': 'Python',
 'course': 'Data Science Masters',
 'topics': ['Python', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning']}

Q8: What are the three view objects in dictionaries? Use the three in-built methods in python to display
these three view objects for the given dictionary.
keys(), values(), items().
dict_keys(['Sport', 'Teams'])
dict_values(['Cricket', ['India', 'Australia', 'England', 'South Africa', 'Sri Lanka', 'New Zealand']])
dict_items([('Sport', 'Cricket'), ('Teams', ['India', 'Australia', 'England', 'South Africa', 'Sri Lanka', 'New Zealand'])])
